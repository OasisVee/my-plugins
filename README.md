## [Sed](https://gitlab.com/Grzesiek11/sed-aliucord-plugin)

was made by Grzesiek11, this is just a port of it to github since i couldnt get gitlab to build (mainly made it so i can make the s catch case-insensitive)

## CatUITH

fork of UITH by scrazzz with a focus on Catbox (other hosts still work, will update the readme for CatUITH so that is updated from UITH when i can be bothered)

### what was changed from the original

- added a default json config for the fetching that is Catbox
- added a userhash option to the settings to set the userhash for Catbox
- added a reset button to reset any user added json for the fetching to default
- added a custom theme to the settings page (trying to implement a toggle for it in case the user wants to use the default theme)
