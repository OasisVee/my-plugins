# Plugins

A collection of Aliucord plugins I've made or modified. (mostly modified)

## AnimeImageFetch ‚ö†Ô∏èNSFW‚ö†Ô∏è

Replacement for Nekoslife that uses the [waifu.pics](https://waifu.pics) API instead. Includes NSFW categories unlike the original.

- **Command:** `/animefetch`

## CatUITH

Fork of UITH (originally by scrazzz) focused on Catbox integration. Still supports other hosting services.

### Changes from original:
- Default config set up for Catbox
- Userhash setting for Catbox uploads
- Reset button to restore default config
- Custom theme (working on a toggle)
- Configurable upload timeout
- Album support:
  - `/cuith album` - start album mode
  - `/cuith finishalb` - finish album and get link
  - `/cuith cancelalb` - cancel album mode

## Sed

Port of [Grzesiek11's Sed plugin](https://gitlab.com/Grzesiek11/sed-aliucord-plugin). Main change is adding case-insensitive matching for the 's' command. Ported it here because building on GitLab was a pain.

## Skull

Fork of Moyai that plays Matt Rose screaming "SKULL EMOJI" when you send üíÄ, react with üíÄ, or type "skull emoji".
